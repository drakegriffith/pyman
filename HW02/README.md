# 📖 [Getting Started]

## 🏕️ Setting up the Environment 

> Concepts: `cmd line` `conda` `jupyter`

We previously have used IDLE (Integrated Development and Learning Environment) as
our IDE for Python. Instead, we shall switch to **requiring** the installation 
of the package manager [Conda][] to elevate efficiency and convenience for our future.

[Conda]: https://www.anaconda.com/

Conda is an open-source package management system and environment management systen
that runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux. We install packages and add them into our
environment to access modules and methods from within these packages. 
>**Anaconda**, the robust version of Conda, contains over 1500 packages automatically installed at once. 
>**Miniconda** is the condensed version of Conda. Miniconda builds an environment from stratch
> by installing only the packages the individual needs. We'll use `conda install package_name` to install any other packages we need
> through the terminal 📦.

Minidoka can be quicker, but we'll start with Anaconda. Over 250 of the most popular data science 
packages are automatically installed with Anaconda, so it occupies around 3.2 GBs of storage. 

The file system on our computers is structured like a tree. Just how we can 
navigate through our file system by clicking around on an interface like Finder
or File Explorer, we can do the same through our command line.
